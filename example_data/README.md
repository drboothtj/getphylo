# getphylo examples

Here are three examples of trees generated by `getphylo`. To recreate each tree for yourself, simply copy the genbank files from each folder into a new directory and type the command as shown below. All images in this section were created by viewing the resulting combined_tree.tree in iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/).

## Example 1 - Bacterial Genomes
The first example is a genome level phylogeny of bacteria. It was run with the command ´getphylo -g '*.gb'´. It was The run took 43 seconds.

## Example 2 - Eukaryotic Mitochondrial Genomes
The second example is a phylogeny of eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes. It was generated in less than X seconds.

## Example 3 - Biosynthetic Super Cluster
The third example shows the evolutionary history of the anthrabenzoxocinone-borregomycin supercluster (*bab*) as described in our paper: ['Chlorinated metabolites from Streptomyces sp. highlight the role of biosynthetic mosaics and superclusters in the evolution of chemical diversity.'](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1OB00600B) It was generated in X seconds.
